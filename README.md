# 95voices

Based on some meter-long German ballot that started off with the words
"You have 95 voices …", which my brain autocompleted to "… and 94
of them are humming the melody of tetris."

Example usage:

```
./95voices.py "This is a coherent sentence." \
  "Here comes another meaningful thought." \
  "3 The melody of tetris, three times." \
  "1 That makes six simultaneous thoughts!"
```

Example output:

```
 That The The This melody The melody of is makes Here tetris, three six
 comes a of another simultaneous thoughts! meaningful tetris, three melody
 of tetris, three times. coherent thought. sentence. times. times.
```
